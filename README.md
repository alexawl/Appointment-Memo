# Barks and Rec

_Developed by Tracie Masek_ 

Barks and Rec is a role-based user app that facilitates communication about the adoption process between an animal rescue or shelter and its potential adopters.

Adopter users can submit an application to adopt, and track its status. Adopters can learn more about the dogs that are up for adoption and can favorite dogs they have an eye on.

The rescue admin users can add, edit, and view adoptable dog profiles. Admins can view registered adopters, and review their applications for adoption approval based on a task list generated by each application submission. Once an admin completes a task, the corresponding adopter's application status is updated accordingly.

Please find the repo for the backend at [Barks-and-Rec-API](https://github.com/traciemasek/barks-and-rec-api). You'll first need to follow the instructions on the README for the API in order to spin up the server, establish a JWT secret, and seed some starter dogs and admin client. Note: the API calls require you to start the Rails server on port 3001 to communicate with the front end `rails s -p 3001`
